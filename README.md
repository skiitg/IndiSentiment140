# IndiSentiment140
We generate parallel corpora, known as IndiSentiment140, translating Sentiment140 into 22 Indian languages supported by Google Translate. We have considered 22 Indian languages i.e. Assamese (as), Bengali (bn), Bhojpuri (bho), Dogri(doi), Gujarati (gu), Hindi (hi), Kannada (kn), Konkani (gom), Maithili (mai), Malayalam (ml), Marathi(Mr), Meiteilon (Manipuri) (mni), Mizo (lus), Nepali (ne), Odia (or), Punjabi(pa), Sanskrit (sa), Sindhi (sd), Sinhala (si), Tamil (ta), Telugu (te), and Urdu (ur) for our study. We have created the dataset for each language listed above after translating the  Sentiment140 dataset to the corresponding language. The same sentiment labels are kept back after translating to different Indian languages.
